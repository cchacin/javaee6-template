We start with Apache Tomcat, add our jars and zip up the rest.\r\nThe result is Tomcat with added EE features - TomEE.\r\n\r\n# Technologies:\r\n\r\n## [OpenJPA](http://openjpa.apache.org/)\r\nApache OpenJPA is a Java persistence project at The Apache Software Foundation that can be used as a stand-alone POJO persistence layer or integrated into any Java EE compliant container and many other lightweight frameworks, such as Tomcat and Spring.\r\n\r\n## [CXF](http://cxf.apache.org/)\r\nApache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.\r\n\r\n## [OpenWebBeans](http://openwebbeans.apache.org/)\r\nApache OpenWebBeans delivers an implementation of the Contexts and Dependency injection for Java EE (CDI) 1.0 Specification (JSR299).\r\nOpenWebBeans is TCK compliant and works on Java SE 5 or later.\r\n\r\n## [BVal](http://bval.apache.org/)\r\nApache BVal delivers an implementation of the Java Bean Validation (JSR303) Specification which is TCK compliant, works on Java SE 5 or later, and uses the Apache Software License v2.0.\r\n\r\n# External Libraries\r\n\r\n## [Redisson](https://github.com/mrniko/redisson)\r\nRedisson - distributed and scalable Java data structures (Set, SortedSet, Map, ConcurrentMap, List, Queue, Deque, Lock, AtomicLong, CountDownLatch, Publish / Subscribe, HyperLogLog) on top of Redis server. Advanced redis java client\r\n\r\n## [DeltaSpike](http://deltaspike.apache.org/index.html)\r\nDeltaSpike consists of a number of portable CDI extensions that provide useful features for Java application developers.\r\n\r\n## [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)\r\nJackson is a suite of data-processing tools for Java (and JVM platform), including the flagship JSON parsing and generation library, as well as additional modules to process data encoded in Avro, CBOR, CSV, Smile, XML or YAML (and list of supported format is still growing!)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
